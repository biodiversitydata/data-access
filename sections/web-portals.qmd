# {{< fa globe size=1x >}} &nbsp;&nbsp;Web portals (5 min)

<!--Slide 1 -->

## Imagine: you're doing some species distribution models. 

> You have a **list of species** and their **occurrences in space and time**. 

You need: 

- spatial data of France, to map the occurrences

- trait information for each species, for 3 specific traits



<!--Slide 2 -->

## Some portals are more straight-foraward than others...

Example of GADM maps: <https://gadm.org/>

They have a nice description of [file formats](https://gadm.org/formats.html) too.


<!--Slide 3 -->
### Open in R:

```{r}
#| echo: true

sf::st_layers(here::here("data/gadm41_FRA.gpkg"))
```

<!--Slide 3 -->

## Open in R:
```{r}
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)
fr <- sf::read_sf(here::here("data/gadm41_FRA.gpkg"), layer = "ADM_ADM_1")
head(fr)
```



<!--Slide 3 -->

## Open in R:

```{r}
#| echo: true

ggplot(fr) + geom_sf(aes(fill = NAME_1)) + theme_bw() 
```


<!--Slide 4 -->

## Imagine: you're doing some species distribution models. 

Now you have: 

- spatial data of France, to map the occurrences &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{< fa circle-check >}}

But you still need:

- trait information for each species, for 3 specific traits

### Before anything else:

Imagine precisely what kind of data you need. *Draw* the table you want to get.

## TRY: a database for plant traits


> **TRY data portal**: [https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/dp.php](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/dp.php)

### 1. Understand how the data is structured

Check out the [data explorer](https://www.try-db.org/de/de.php) section.

*What are the traits like ? How are they measured ? If there are several measures of the same trait, which one will you choose ?*

*What are the traits like ? How are they measured ? If there are several measures of the same trait, which one will you choose ?* 


Explore the `trait table`.

Let's try  `leaf area` --> 88 traits contain "leaf area" in their description!

Notice the  `Trait ID`  column, this is what you'll need to query the trait(s) you select.

> Trait IDs examples: LAI = 3116 , Flower size = 3568, Photosynthesis : intercellular CO2 concentration = 49

**Other table fields:**

- `ObsNum`: Number of Observations

- `ObsGRNum`: Number of geo-referenced Observations

- `AccSpecNum`: Number of Accepted Species




<!--Slide 6 -->

## 2. Look at the species list

Get species IDs: 

- *Arabidopsis thaliana* : 4341

- *Bellis perennis* : 7173

- *Quercus ilex* : 45402

Get species IDS: 

- Arabidopsis thaliana : 4341

- Bellis perennis: 7173

- Quercus ilex: 45402

**Get data**

Register, go to `request data`. Now you can file in the trait IDs.

Submit request. Write a short description of your project. You'll receive a text file by email within a few days.

> Requesting data can take several days.



<!--Slide 7 -->

## You may encounter encoding issues....

```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: true

t <- read.csv(here::here("data/36266.txt"), sep="\t")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

readr::guess_encoding(here::here("data/36266.txt"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

t <- utils::read.csv2(file = file(here::here("data/36266.txt"), encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'), sep="\t")
colnames(t)
```

<!-- Side 8 -->

## Alternative import *via* R:

The quite handy R package `rtry`.

Solves the encoding problem: 



```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

t2 <- rtry::rtry_import(here::here("data/36266.txt"))
```



And this takes us to the next section...
